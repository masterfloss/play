ACT I
Setting: A dimly lit tavern near the Lisbon docks, adorned with maritime artifacts and faded maps of the known world.
Introduction:
Dom Henrique and João are seated at a table with an ancient map unfurled. Henrique boasts to João about his latest scheme to sell forged treasure maps to desperate nobles.
HENRIQUE: Ah, João, nothing stirs the heart of these fools like the promise of gold. They’ll believe anything if it’s wrapped in a tale of adventure.
JOAO: But, Dom Henrique, what if someone discovers the maps are false?
HENRIQUE: Nonsense! By the time they realize, I’ll be long gone with their coin.
The door creaks open. Maria and Manuel enter, their faces shadowed by the flickering lantern light.
MARIA: Dom Henrique, they say you possess maps that lead to treasures buried by our great navigators.
HENRIQUE: Indeed, my lady. These maps were passed down by men who sailed with Vasco da Gama himself. But such secrets come at a price.
MARIA: Name it. My family’s estates are crumbling, and I must save them.
HENRIQUE: Fifty gold escudos.
MANUEL: Be cautious, my lady. These waters are treacherous, and not just at sea.
MARIA: I’ll take the risk.
Henrique hands Maria a map, smirking as she and Manuel leave.

ACT II
Setting: A desolate cove where Maria and Manuel follow the map’s instructions. The wind howls, and the sea crashes against jagged rocks.
MARIA: We’ve searched every inch, and there’s no treasure here.
MANUEL: I feared as much. The map is a fraud.
A ghostly figure emerges from the shadows, glowing faintly in the moonlight.
Specter of the Navigator: Who dares disturb the legacy of the Discoveries with deceit?
MARIA: Who... who are you?
SPECTER: I am the spirit of those who braved the unknown for the glory of Portugal. Tell me, why have you come?
MARIA: To save my family. I was tricked by a merchant who sold me this map.
SPECTER: Justice must be done. Return to him and confront his greed. I shall ensure he faces the consequences.

ACT III
Setting: Dom Henrique’s lavish home, filled with the spoils of his schemes. Maria and Manuel burst in, accompanied by the Specter, now invisible to Henrique and João.
MARIA: Dom Henrique! Your lies have brought us nothing but misery.
HENRIQUE: Lies? My lady, you must have misunderstood the map.
The Specter appears, glowing fiercely. Henrique and João recoil in terror.
SPECTER: You have dishonored the legacy of Portugal’s explorers. For your greed, you shall lose all you’ve stolen.
The room begins to shake. The gold and treasures in Henrique’s home dissolve into sand.
JOAO: What sorcery is this?
SPECTER: A lesson in humility. Remember this day when you think of deceit.
Henrique collapses to his knees, sobbing.
MARIA: Let this be a warning. Portugal’s greatness lies in courage and honesty, not in trickery.

EPILOGUE
Henrique abandons his schemes and becomes a humble trader. Maria and Manuel, with the Specter’s blessing, uncover a genuine treasure that restores her family’s fortune.
SPECTER: Honor the past, and it shall guide your future.
